    "What the following lessons will teach you is how to create strings and then manipulate them to your liking. You'll then be tested on what you learned and your ability to use what you learned to do something entirely new in the hacks.\n",

    "### Characteristics\n",
    "1. Strings are **immutable** This means once a string has been created, it can't be modified, requiring the programmer to create new strings when manipulating the original string to save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strings can be **indexed**. Indexing strings is the process of accessing a character or characters from a string. This is often helpful when we only want a key part of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Strings can be **concatenated**. Concatenating strings is the process of combining two strings together to make one new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Strings use **methods/functions**. Methods or Functions allow us to manipulate strings in a variety of ways and for a variety of reasons."

    "With this, you should be more than ready to take a look at the lessons."
