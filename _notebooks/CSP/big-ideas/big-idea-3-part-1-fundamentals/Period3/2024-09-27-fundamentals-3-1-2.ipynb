    "## Question 1: Variable Naming Conventions (SnakeCase, PascalCase, CamelCase)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign a value to a variable using the proper naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A: Create a variable using snake case called my_favorite_color and set its value to \"blue\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_favorite_color = \"blue\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Part B: Now, create a variable using PascalCase called MyFavoriteColor and set its value to \"green\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "MyFavoriteColor = \"green\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Part C: Finally, create a variable using CamelCase called myFavoriteColor and set its value to \"red\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "myFavoriteColor = \"red\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part D: Explain why the PascalCase variable name should not be used in Python for regular variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "PascalCase is reserved for class names in Python, not regular variables, which should use SnakeCase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2: Types of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A: Assign the following values to variables:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# 1. An integer my_age with the value 21.\n",
    "my_age = 21\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. A float pi_value with the value 3.14159.\n",
    "pi_value = 3.14159\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. A boolean is_student with the value True.\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. A string greeting_message with the value \"Hello, World!\".\n",
    "greeting_message = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Part B: Print each of these variables to see the output.\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Integer Value\n",
    "print(my_age)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Float Value\n",
    "print(pi_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boolean Value\n",
    "print(is_student)\n",
    "\n",
    "# String value\n",
    "print(greeting_message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3: How Variables Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A: Assign the string \"Python Programming\" to a variable called course_name.\n",
    "```\n",
    "course_name = \"Python Programming\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, print the following sentence using this variable:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"I am learning \" + course_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Part B: Assign the integer 10 to a variable called num_items (more commonly shortened to just \"n\").\n",
    "```\n",
    "num_items = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, print a sentence using this variable:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Remember to use str() to convert the integer to a string when printing.\n",
    "print(\"You have \" + str(num_items) + \" items in your cart.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part C: Why do we need to use the str() function when printing the num_items variable in Part B?\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: We need to use str() because Python cannot concatenate strings with integers directly. The str() function converts the integer into a string, allowing us to print it alongside other strings."
