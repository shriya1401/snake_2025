    "\n",
    "**Nested conditionalsare a fundamental concept in programming where one conditional statement is placed inside another. This allows for more complex decision-making processes and enables programs to handle a wider range of scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "1. **Understand what nested conditionals are.**\n",
    "2. **Write pseudocode using nested conditionals.**\n",
    "3. **Apply nested conditionals to solve problems.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Conditional Statements`: Used to perform different actions based on different conditions.\n",
    "2. `Nested Conditionals`: A conditional statement inside another conditional statement.\n",
